# Contributing to ACARS Hub

Thank you for helping to improve ACARS Hub! The code base for ACARS Hub has been continuously linted and undergoes linting checks before being accepted. To help your code be correctly formatted before you submit a PR, please ensure you have `pre-commit` installed for this repo ([see here](docs/Pre-Commit-Hooks.MD) for instructions). Once installed git will automatically run the linting before your code is committed. Please fix any errors it kicks out.

Please see [dev environment](dev-enviornment-setup.MD) for instructions on how to build ACARS Hub locally, as well as run it outside of docker for testing.
